# poc-react-ssr
This is proof of concept for a React SSR, SPA application.

Same POC with Next.js: 
https://github.com/FlorinGologan/poc-react-ssr-next

## Install / Run 
```
npm install
npm run dev
```

See the results: 
```
http://localhost:3000/
```


## To do
- apis response error handling:  show/redirect 404 or show a custom message (depending on the source)     
- webpack: split output into multiple files (test the speed)
